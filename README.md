####Brief
Create a game based on the Mazogs theme with the set of features as follows:
*The game should generate a random 60x60 maze with one or more exits. The player
character should be placed in the maze as far from the exit(s) as possible. The
objective of the game should be to find a way out of the maze.
*The game should be graphical and use arrow keys and other options to move around.
 
*The maze should be patrolled by spiders or other characters that should be
threaded, i.e. the creatures should move independently through the maze. Each
character should use one or more traversal / search algorithms to control its
movements.
*A number of weapons should be available in the maze. Users should be able to select
from different types of weapons, e.g. a sword, grenade or even an A-bomb (the latter
two could use a depth-limited DFS to destroy everything within a limit of n moves).
You could even use a depth-limited DFS as a "radar" to show where "life forms" exist
nearby.
*A number of prisoners or something similar should also be available in the maze.
Interacting with one of these should fire a heuristically informed algorithm that
displays a path through the maze for a limited amount of time or steps.
